      <description>This solution describes and compares the different design approaches for calling a machine learning model during a Dataflow pipeline, and examines the tradeoffs involved in choosing one approach or another. We present the results of a series of experiments that we ran to explore different approaches and illustrate these tradeoffs, both in batch and stream processing pipelines. This solution is designed for people who integrate trained models into data processing pipelines, rather than for data scientists who want to build machine learning models.</description>
